# OS/390 2.10 (ACF/VTAM 5.0)

This is talking to the VM/ESA system over a CTC link, but also to a NT4, Win2K, and OS/2 system over an Ethernet link. 
This is basically the same as the IBM defaults, but, I debloated it a good bit to make it easier to read.

These same definitions are good for MVS/ESA 5.x.x if you need them.

This machine is set as follows:
Subarea 6
Netid HSNET
SSCPID OS390
