# VM/ESA 2.4 (ACF/VTAM 4.2)

Some things to note:
- VMVTAM GCS and PROFILE GCS are slightly modified from the P/390 ADCD default
- ASMUSS EXEC provides an easy way to reassemble your login screen assembler programs
- This is a simple network consisting of VM/ESA talking to OS/390 and VSE/ESA over CTCAs
- Windows NT and OS/2 are talked to with APPN over Ethernet links
- AGWPROF GCS is for AVSVM
